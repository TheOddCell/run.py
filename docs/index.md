# Run.py
a tool for running ipython files via python3

## Requirements
Ipython (full install: `sudo apt install ipython3`)

## How to use
Use `python3 run.py` to run and
`python3 run.py help` to get help.

### Addons!
To make addons,
   1. Create a file alongside run.py
   2. Add "import run" at the top
   3. change vars (runpyfilename, helpfilename, message (the help message))
   4. add the code "run.py()" to run or "run.showhelp()" to show help at the end.
   5. Use run.devhelp() for developer help and
   6. Use run.createfile() to create a dummy file.
      
Done!

To run the addon, run THAT py!

for AutoRun, make the addon name "run.addon.py", without the qwotes.
